# Interesting Trends have seen on Stack Overflow Survey 2019

The motivation behind this project is to use to carry out an EDA analysis of the 2019 Stack Overflow Developer Survey Data analysis to uncover answers to the following crucial questions:
* What is the highest level of formal education from top respondent countries?
* What are your most significant challenges to productivity as a developer?
* What are Job factors which developers would admire to have in their Role/Organization?

## Data and Code

The primary analysis is contained in the 2019 Stack Overflow Survey Analysis.ipynb jupyter notebook. All the functions and code, as well as the rationale behind the decisions taken, are in this notebook.

Data for the analysis is available at: [survey datasets](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey)

## Prerequisites

* Pandas
* seaborn
* Matplotlib
* Numpy

## Observation 

* Respondents from top countries have a maximum formal education of a Bachelor’s degree except in countries like Germany, France, Russia, Ukraine, and Poland Respondents having formal education of Master’s degrees are more than a Bachelor’s Degree.

* Distracting/toxic work environment is the most significant challenges faced by Developers and they also don't like to work on not-development tasks 

* We observed that Programming Languages I’d be working with, office environment of company culture, and flex-time were the most promising job factors developers would consider if they got a job offer from two companies, which provides the same Compensation, benefits, and location and most developers did not consider factors like the diversity of the company, the department I’d be working on, and the funding status of the company.
